                    <h2>A little bit about me! </h2>
                    <p>Having experience with HTML & CSS, I wanted to dive deeper into 
                       <br>web building and design. I started with JavaScript which led
                        <br>me to the REACT framework. I'm currently using REACT for web
                        <br>development and Python for my automation projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>Automating tasks with Python gave me great insight on how it pertains
                        <br>to information security. I've become engrossed with cybersecurity
                        <br>and started writing scripts with Python that I would then use on
                        <br>home made honeypots and gradually moved into PowerShell scripting
                        <br>as well as understanding Linux security and hardening. Now having piles 
                        <br>of certifications within information security and 100's of hours solving
                        <br>potential security risks within my homelab, I believe I carry the tools 
                        <br>and knowledge to solve any problem within these fields. 
                    </p>
