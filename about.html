                    <h2>A little bit about me! </h2>
                    <p>Having experience with HTML & CSS, I wanted to dive deeper into 
                       <br>web building and design. I started with JavaScript which led
                        <br>me to the REACT framework. I'm currently using REACT for web
                        <br>design and Python for my automation projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>Automating tasks with Python gave me great insight on how it pertains
                        <br>to information security. I started with small scripts that I would
                        <br>use on home made honeypots and gradually moved into PowerShell
                        <br>scripting as well as linux security and hardening. Now having piles 
                        <br>of certifications within information security, I carry the tools and
                        <br>and knowledge to handle and problem within these fields. 
                    </p>
