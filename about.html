                    <h2>A little bit about me! </h2>
                    <p>Having experience with HTML & CSS, I wanted to dive deeper into 
                       <br>web building and design. I started with JavaScript which led
                        <br>me into the REACT framework. I currently have projects with REACT 
                        <br>but have yet to publish due to them being incomplete.
                    </p>
                    <p>I then wanted to understand how automating tasks with Python
                        <br>worked and how that pertains to information security.
                        <br>I started with small scripts that I would use on home made
                        <br>honeypots and haven't stopped learninig since I started.
                    </p>
